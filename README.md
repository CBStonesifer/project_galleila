# Project Galleila — Beater-Bar BattleBot

A 3-pound (beetleweight) combat robot designed and built across the full hardware stack: mechanical CAD, PCB layout, and embedded firmware. The goal was a **reproducible end-to-end build process** — from CAD model to fabricated board to driving firmware — rather than peak performance. V2 will optimize for weight and combat performance.

**Skills demonstrated:** Fusion 360 / FDM prototyping · KiCad schematic + layout · custom footprint creation · Gerber fabrication output · ESP32 embedded C · RC PWM decode · LEDC motor PWM · skid-steer mixing

## Design Decisions

- **Beater bar weapon** — a relatively simple and proven design with high impact potential in the arena. The main weakness is being flipped; a lower profile in V2 addresses this directly.
- **Skid-steer drivetrain** — keeps mechanical complexity low while maintaining full mobility. No steering linkage, no Ackermann geometry, just two independently driven wheels.
- **Belt-driven weapon** — the GT2 20T/60T pulley ratio amplifies the motor's output speed to spin the beater bar faster than a direct-drive setup would allow.
- **Unitary printed body** — a single-piece chassis provides structural strength without mechanical interlocks between parts. Drive and weapon geometry were validated as separate prints first, then merged once the layout was confirmed.

## CAD

**Tool:** Fusion 360 → FDM (PLA-CF)  
**All parts:** `cad/` — available as both `.stl` and `.3mf`

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `chassis.stl` / `.3mf` | Unitary chassis: electronics bay, drive motor mounts, weapon mount |
| `drive_wheel.stl` / `.3mf` | Drive wheels (print ×2) |
| `weapon_impactor.stl` / `.3mf` | Beater-bar weapon impactor |

Drive and weapon subsystems were first validated as separate prints, then consolidated into a single `chassis` once geometry was confirmed. Total bot target: ≤ 3 lb; drive motors are the dominant mass — body is designed to be as light as possible.

## Firmware

**Toolchain:** Arduino IDE + ESP32 board support package  
**Board target:** ESP32 Wrover Module  
**Sketch:** `firmware/signal_driver/signal_driver.ino`

### Control Loop

```
loop()
  ├── readSteering()   — pulseIn GPIO 35 → map to [-100, 100] → deadband
  ├── readThrottle()   — pulseIn GPIO 34 → map to [-100, 100] → deadband
  ├── pulseIn GPIO 18  — weapon toggle (> 1500 µs = ON)
  ├── mixAndDrive()    — skid-steer mix → setMotor() → LEDC PWM duty
  ├── setWeapon()      — full speed on WEAPON_IN1/IN2 when armed
  └── fault poll       — read GPIO 33 nFAULT → Serial.print @ 115200
```

### Motor Mixing

- **Straight:** `left = right = throttle`
- **Driving turn:** inner wheel = `throttle × (TURN_MIX_RATIO / 100)`
- **Spin-in-place:** `left = +steering`, `right = −steering`

### Calibration Constants

| Constant | V1 Value | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `STEERING_MIN` | 965 µs | Min receiver pulse |
| `STEERING_MAX` | 1882 µs | Max receiver pulse |
| `THROTTLE_MIN` | 1055 µs | Min throttle pulse |
| `THROTTLE_IDLE` | 1565 µs | Neutral position |
| `THROTTLE_MAX` | 2000 µs | Max throttle pulse |
| `DEADBAND` | 5 | Noise rejection around neutral |
| `TURN_MIX_RATIO` | 50 | Inner-wheel scaling (0–100) |
| `PWM_FREQ` | 20,000 Hz | LEDC motor PWM frequency |
| `PWM_RES` | 8-bit | Duty cycle range (0–255) |

> These constants are radio-specific. Re-measure pulse widths for your transmitter before first drive.

### Flash Instructions

1. Install ESP32 board support in Arduino IDE
2. Open `firmware/signal_driver/signal_driver.ino`
3. Select **ESP32 Wrover Module**, set the correct COM port
4. Update calibration constants for your RC radio
5. Upload

## Testing & Validation

The bot was driven under full battery power with all systems operating independently:

- **Drive** — successfully accelerated, turned, and reversed at varying speeds under RC control.
- **Weapon** — spun up to full speed and was toggled on and off from the transmitter.
- **Carpet performance** — struggled on carpet. The wheels lacked grip, and the design relies on the body sliding along the ground to stay low against opponents — which doesn't work well on high-friction surfaces.
- **Battery connector** — the 3-pin JST-XH plugs do not physically prevent reverse polarity insertion. Connecting the battery backwards is easy to do and will damage the board.

---

## Known Issues & Further Improvements (V2)

- **Chassis Side Overhangs** — the overhangs on the side were quickly added to thicken the width of the walls to strengthen the bot, and for style. They provide a grip for another bot to easily flip the vehicle. The next design should minimize the gap between the side edges and the ground.
- **Hard Power Cut-Off** — as per NHRL rules, the bot requires a quick physical power disconnect to disable movement and weapon systems, not just a code deactivation.
- **Hardened weapon impactor** — machine or print in PETG/nylon/polycarbonate; evaluate a metal impactor for the beater bar.
- **Weight optimization** — the current design is 2.76 lbs, which leaves room to upgrade/add additional parts (i.e. the weapon material should be metal).
- **Optimize print settings** — a final print with more granular layer heights and higher infill will strengthen the hull.
- **A Roof** — the top of the bot needs a solid roof that could also act as a battery retainer. Batteries are currently loose within the chassis.
- **Sweet Paint Job** — the bot needs some decals and a layer of spray paint to make it look more threatening.
- **Wheel Grips and Covers** — the wheels are exposed and use electrical tape for grip. They must be better protected, as immobility is an immediate loss in the arena. A set of proper tires would help with mobility, and the front shovel can catch on uneven surfaces.
- **Beater Bar orientation is reversed** — the edge of the beater bar faces inward, counter to the direction the bar spins. Opposing robots are hit with the blunt edge of the weapon rather than the sharp, scraping side that should brush close to the ground.

## Tools Required

- **3D printer** — Bambu A1 (or equivalent FDM printer capable of PLA-CF)
- **Soldering iron** — flux is mandatory; makes the joints significantly cleaner and easier
- **Wire stripper**
- **Extra header pins**
- **Assorted screws and a screwdriver**
